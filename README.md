## <span id="description">Description</span>

A website called DiscOthello allows you to sign up and/or log in and play the game of Othello in three different 3D modes: solo: this mode lets you experiment and develop various tactics, AI mode allows you to play against the computer and try out various strategies, while multiplayer mode allows you to play Othello face-to-face with another player. However, if you are unable to play, there is a page that explains how to do so. Additionally, a chat bot enables you to converse with other players worldwide.There aren't many 3D and online Othello games, which is what gave rise to DiscOthello.

The project started as a way to challenge ourselves and create something engaging and fun for all ages. It evolved into a portfolio project for Holberton School, showcasing our skills and creativity. The project was developed over a two-month period, from initial concept to final implementation. We're proud of the work we've done and can't wait to share it with the world.
